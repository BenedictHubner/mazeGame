# mazeGame
A simple HTML/JS game that creates progressively larger mazes to navigate.
Each maze also contains a randomly placed 'key' to fetch before being able to leave.

Currently start and end are always in the same relative position.

Not the perfect implementation by any means. The code for making the maze was salvaged from an old project in Java, which could probably already have been done better, then adapted for this.
